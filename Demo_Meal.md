# ✈️ Thai Airways Meal Prediction System: Demo Pitch

**Audience:** Top Management / Executives
**Goal:** Explain why we need to stop "guessing" meal loads and start "predicting" them using AI.

---

## 1. Executive Summary (The "Elevator Pitch")

### The Problem: The "Dinner Party" Dilemma
Imagine you are hosting a dinner party for 300 strangers. You don't know what they like to eat, so you just guess: *"Let's cook 50% Chicken and 50% Beef."*
**The Result?**
1.  You have 50 leftover Chicken meals (Waste).
2.  You run out of Beef, and 50 guests go hungry or angry (Bad Experience).

Now, imagine doing this for **200 flights every single day**. That is our current situation. We rely on "historical averages" and "guessing."

### The Solution
Our **AI Meal Prediction System** acts like a smart event planner. It looks at the guest list (Passenger Manifest), checks the calendar (Is it Friday?), and understands the destination culture. It tells us *exactly* what to load.

### Why We Need This Specifically
1.  **Stop Waste:** We currently over-load meals "just in case." This tool cuts that cost immediately.
2.  **Happy Passengers:** We ensure the right meal is available for the right person. No more *"Sorry, we are out of your choice."*
3.  **Speed:** A human takes hours to analyze a flight manifest. This AI does it in 20 seconds.

## 2. Live Demo: The "Friday Flight" Scenario

**The Scenario:** We are planning catering for **Flight AA-471** from **Bangkok to Beijing** on a **Friday**.

### Step 1: The Setup (The Blind Spot)
*(Action: Select Flight AA-471 and Date Nov 28, 2025)*

**Say:** "Here is our flight to Beijing. We have 150 passengers.
*   **The Old Way:** A catering manager sees 'China Route' and loads the standard mix: mostly Pork and Chicken.
*   **The Risk:** They might miss specific details about *this specific Friday*."

### Step 2: The Brain (Master Metrics)
*(Action: Click 'Continue' to Master Metrics)*

**Say:** "This is the brain of the system. It doesn't just guess. It calculates based on 4 real facts:
1.  **Who is flying?** (Nationality & Age from the booking list).
2.  **Where are they going?** (Destination culture).
3.  **What time is it?** (Breakfast vs. Dinner).
4.  **Research:** It uses real data from global food studies (like WHO data).

*Note: We can adjust these sliders manually if we need to, so Humans are always in control.*"

### Step 3: The Process (Visualizing the AI)
*(Action: Click 'Predict'. Narrate while the purple bar fills up)*

**Say:** "I click Predict. Watch the system work in real-time:
*   It reads the passenger list...
*   It sees 'Friday'...
*   It sees 'Beijing'...
*   It runs the math to find the perfect balance."

### Step 4: The Insight (The "Aha!" Moment)
*(Action: Land on Results. Point to the **'Why This Prediction?'** card)*

**Say:** "Here is the magic. Look at what the AI found:
> **'Friday Fresh Seafood Market tradition.'**

The AI knows that on Fridays, passengers flying to Beijing crave **Seafood** much more than usual. A human planner using a standard checklist would miss this cultural detail."

### Step 5: The Business Impact (Money & Experience)
*(Action: Scroll to the **'AI-Predicted Meal Proportions'** table)*

**Say:** "Let's see the difference between our 'Standard Plan' and the 'AI Prediction':

1.  **Seafood (Customer Experience):**
    *   **Plan:** We were going to load **26**.
    *   **AI Says:** Load **35**.
    *   **Impact:** We saved **9 passengers** from being disappointed. These are often our high-value customers.

2.  **Lamb (Cost Savings):**
    *   **Plan:** We were going to load **6**.
    *   **AI Says:** Load **4**.
    *   **Impact:** We stop buying expensive meat that no one eats. That is **33% less waste** on this item."

## 3. The Vision: Enterprise Automation

**Say:** "What I showed you is the **Interactive Mode**—perfect for checking specific flights.

But we don't need to do this manually.
*   **Behind the Scenes:** We can set this to run automatically for **all 200 daily flights** every night at 2:00 AM.
*   **Scale:** It applies these 'Smart Metrics' to every single route, saving us money while we sleep.

**Conclusion:**
We move from **Reactive Guessing** to **Proactive Precision**.
*   **Less Waste.**
*   **Better Service.**
*   **Smarter Operations.**"

## 4. Q&A (Cheat Sheet)

**Q: "Is this connected to our real booking system?"**
*   **A:** "For this demo, we use a snapshot of data (CSV files). In the real version, it plugs directly into our reservation system."

**Q: "Can we trust the AI?"**
*   **A:** "The AI is a guide, not the boss. The Catering Manager always has the final approval. But now, they approve based on *data*, not just intuition."

**Q: "How does it know about the Seafood tradition?"**
*   **A:** "It is trained on historical data and cultural research papers. It learns patterns—like 'Fridays in Beijing'—that humans might forget."

## 🎬 The Demo Script

### 1. The Setup: "The Blind Spot"
*(Start on the **Flight Selection Screen**)*

"Let's look at a specific scenario that challenges our current manual planning.

We have flight **AA-471**, departing Bangkok for Beijing (PEK) this coming **Friday, November 28th**.
*   **Total Passengers:** 150
*   **Pre-booked Meals:** 45
*   **Meals to Predict:** 105 (These are the 'unknowns' we usually guess on)"

*(Action: Select Flight AA-471 and Date Nov 28, 2025)*

"Traditionally, a catering manager would look at this and say, 'It's a standard China route, load the standard mix.' But they might miss the subtle data points that drive actual behavior."

### 2. The Science: "Master Metrics & Human-in-the-Loop"
*(Action: Click 'Continue' to Master Metrics. Pause here to show the sliders and data sources.)*

"This is the brain of the system: **The Master Metrics**.

These aren't random numbers. They are pre-calculated based on deep historical data and academic research. For example:
*   **Nationality Data:** Sourced from *WHO Global Food Consumption* and *Buddhist Dietary Practices* studies.
*   **Meal Time Logic:** Aligned with *Sleep Foundation* guidelines (e.g., lighter proteins for late-night flights).

**The Power of Control:**
While the AI provides a strong baseline, we keep the human in the loop.
*   **Adjustable Weights:** If you know a specific tour group is onboard, you can manually adjust the 'Nationality' weight.
*   **Live Redefinition:** We can hit 'Redefine' to instantly update these metrics as new research papers or consumption data becomes available.

We combine **Artificial Intelligence** with **Human Intelligence**."

*(Action: Click 'Predict'. The 8-step animation screen appears.)*

### 3. The Process: "Visualizing the AI Brain"
*(Narrate this while the purple progress bar fills up - you have about 20 seconds)*

"What you are seeing now is the system processing millions of data points in real-time.

*   **Step 1 & 2:** It's pulling the live passenger manifest and analyzing the nationality mix (e.g., 60% Chinese, 20% Thai).
*   **Step 4:** It's evaluating the 'Beijing' destination factor—checking for local holidays or cultural events.
*   **Step 6:** The **LLM Model** is now synthesizing this data. It's asking: *'Given a Friday evening flight to Beijing with this demographic mix, what is the probability of a Seafood order?'*

It's doing the complex math that no human can do in their head, instantly."

### 4. The Reveal: "The Friday Seafood Insight"
*(Action: Land on the **Results Dashboard**. Point specifically to the **'Why This Prediction?'** card)*

"Here is the breakthrough. Look at the AI's insight for this specific flight:

> **'Friday Fresh Seafood Market day tradition in Chinese culture increases seafood preference to 33.6%.'**

A manual planner might not know that Friday travel to Beijing correlates with a spike in seafood cravings. The AI *does*."

### 5. The Business Impact: "Planned vs. Predicted"
*(Action: Scroll to the **'AI-Predicted Meal Proportions'** table)*

"Let's look at the financial and operational impact of this insight.

**Row 1: Seafood**
*   **Our Standard Plan:** We were going to load **26** meals.
*   **AI Recommendation:** We need **35** meals.
*   **Impact:** Without this system, **9 passengers** (likely high-value) would have been told, 'Sorry, no seafood.' That is a failed customer experience.

**Row 3: Chicken**
*   **Our Standard Plan:** We were going to load **28** meals.
*   **AI Recommendation:** We only need **25**.
*   **Impact:** We would have wasted **3 meals**.

**Row 6: Lamb**
*   **Our Standard Plan:** **6** meals.
*   **AI Recommendation:** **4** meals.
*   **Impact:** **33% over-catering waste** on an expensive protein."

### 6. The Vision: "Enterprise Automation"

"What you see here is the **Interactive Mode**—perfect for deep-diving into specific high-value or complex flights.

But the real power lies in **Batch Automation**.
*   **Behind the Scenes:** We don't need a human to click through every flight.
*   **Scale:** The system can run this prediction for **all 200+ daily flights** automatically at 2:00 AM every day.
*   **Flexibility:** It can switch between 'Predefined Metrics' for standard routes and 'AI Metrics' for complex ones.

We are building a system that manages the routine automatically, alerting your experts only when anomalies—like our Friday Seafood spike—are detected."

### 7. Summary of Value

"By implementing this, Thai Airways moves from **Reactive Loading** (guessing based on averages) to **Proactive Precision** (knowing based on data).

**The Result:**
1.  **Millions saved** in food waste.
2.  **Premium Passenger Experience** preserved.
3.  **Operational Excellence** at scale."
